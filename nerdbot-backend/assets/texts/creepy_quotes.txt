Here's Johnny!
The power of Christ compels you!
I see dead people.
Be afraid. Be very afraid.
We've traced the call... it's coming from inside the house.
We all float down here. Yes, we do.
One, two, Freddy's coming for you.
We all go a little mad sometimes.
They're here!
Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play?
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
I'm your number one fan.
Quaid, start the reactor.
What's in the box?
I'm not locked in here with you. You're locked in here with me.
Do you want to play a game?
I see you.
I'm not afraid of you.
We're all mad here.
ET phone home.
I'm the king of the world!
I'm the ghost with the most, babe.
I'm the one who knocks.
Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.
I'm the dude.
